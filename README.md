# COVID Model in the Australian Context

This is an Agent-Based Model being built to assist with modeling the spread, health and economic impact of COVID 19 in Australia and policy-settings during its expansion and contraction phase that could limit its damage.

The model is being built as data comes to hand so should be regarded as a work in progress and should not be relied upon as a basis for decision-making at this point. We make no current guarantees about its validity - but then again, neither can anyone else!

The team contributing to this model is promarily based at the University of Melbourne, with input from the University of New England and various other contributors from institutions around Australia and the World. It is made up of Epidemiologists, data scientists, computational social scientists, and social scientists. 

The model will be updated regularly as it is constructed. 

We apologise in advance for the lack of commenting in the code. Hopefully you can read Netlogo. We'll update as we go. We're in a rush at present.

If you have any specific questions or would like to contribute / comment, please contact jason.thompson@unimelb.edu.au .
